# DataMining-DingDing

The LSTM_final.ipynb contains the demo of Bi-LSTM
The sarcasm-detection-Bert contains the demo of Bert

Due to the size of dataset and weights file, we upload the related files to the Baidu Netdisk,
you can simply follow this link https://pan.baidu.com/s/1epQP4Jp7lz1pG6QMHoA5qw and input the code 1234
to get the weights and dataset file which contains DLSTM.hdf5(weights file for Bi-LSTM),
Bert_weights.h5(weights for Bert) and Sarcasm_Dataset(dataset)
