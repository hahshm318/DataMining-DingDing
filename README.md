# DataMining-DingDing

The LSTM_final.ipynb contains the demo of Bi-LSTM.
The sarcasm-detection-Bert contains the demo of Bert.

Due to the size of dataset and weights file, we upload the related files to the Google Netdisk,
you can simply follow this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g8styyioffZEUGjkwxyRKlZ5lVKFwIAX/view?usp=sharing and unzip the zip
to get the weights and dataset file which contains DLSTM.hdf5(weights file for Bi-LSTM), Bert_weights.h5(weights for Bert) and Sarcasm_Dataset(dataset)
